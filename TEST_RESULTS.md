# Testing and Validation

## Test Scenarios
- Low traffic density
- Medium traffic density
- High traffic density
- Uneven lane distribution

## Observations
- Signal timing adapts correctly to vehicle count
- Slave controllers remain synchronized across cycles
- No conflicting signal states observed
- System remains stable during continuous operation

## Conclusion
The system performs reliably under all tested scenarios in a controlled environment.
