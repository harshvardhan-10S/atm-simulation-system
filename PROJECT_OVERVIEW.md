# Project Overview

This document provides a concise overview of the **Smart & AI-Integrated Traffic Signal Control System**.

The project focuses on improving traffic efficiency using real-time vehicle detection and a synchronized embedded control architecture. A centralized master controller determines the active traffic state and communicates it to multiple slave controllers to ensure consistent signal operation.

This system demonstrates the practical integration of:
- Computer vision for real-time sensing
- Embedded system synchronization
- Adaptive decision-making logic
- Modular and scalable traffic control design
